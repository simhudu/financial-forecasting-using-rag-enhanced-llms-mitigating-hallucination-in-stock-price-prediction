# 📈 Financial Forecasting Using RAG-Enhanced LLMs  
## Stock Price Prediction and Risk Analysis  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement  

Stock price forecasting is one of the most economically significant and technically challenging problems in applied machine learning.  

Traditional models such as ARIMA, GARCH, and LSTMs rely only on historical price and volume data. As a result, they fail to capture:  

- Breaking news  
- Earnings announcements  
- Macroeconomic events  

On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) can process textual data but may produce unreliable or unsupported outputs when not grounded in real data.  

---

## ✅ Proposed Solution  

This project combines:  

- Time-series modeling (Transformer / LSTM)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  

This ensures predictions are supported by:  

- Historical price patterns  
- Real financial news data  

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  

This project is a hybrid AI forecasting system built on 22 years of data (2003–2025) for 5 major NSE stocks.  

---

## 🔹 System Architecture  

The system integrates two main streams:  

### 1. Numerical Stream  

- OHLCV stock data  
- Feature engineering (technical indicators)  
- Time-series models (LSTM / Transformer)  

➡️ Output: Pattern-based price prediction  

---

### 2. Textual Stream  

- 50,000 financial news articles  
- Sentiment analysis using NLP models  
- RAG-based retrieval system  

➡️ Output: Context-aware market insights  

---

### 3. Fusion Layer  

Combines numerical + textual signals  

Produces:  

- 📈 Price prediction  
- 📊 Volatility estimation  
- ⚠️ Risk score
